# Question 2: Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.

Answer: Yes Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default if any code in the signals receiver function is executed within the same thread that called the signal blocking it until the receiver completes.
