# Question 1: By default are django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.


Answer: Django signals are executed synchronously by default when a signal is sent Django waits for all connected receiver functions to complete their tasks before moving on. This synchronous means that if the receiver function takes a long time to run, it will make the sender wait until the function finishes before moving on.
